# Enumerables
## This is the project to implement user defined Enumerable methods
1. Create #my_each, a method that is identical to #each but (obviously) does not use #each. Youâ€™ll need to remember the yield statement. Make sure it returns the same thing as #each as well.
2. Create #my_each_with_index in the same way.
3. Create #my_select in the same way, though you may use #my_each in your definition (but not #each).
4. Create #my_all? (continue as above)
5. Create #my_any?
6. Create #my_none?
5. Create #my_count
6. Create #my_map
7. Create #my_inject
8. Test your #my_inject by creating a method called #multiply_els which multiplies all the elements of the array together by using #my_inject, e.g. multiply_els([2,4,5]) #=> 40
9. Modify your #my_map method to take a proc instead.
